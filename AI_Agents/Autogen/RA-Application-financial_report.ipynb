    "* Analyze the correlation between the stocks\n",
    "* Plot their normalized prices for comparison\n",
    "* Downloads the latest news headlines about these assets and then analyzes and summarizes these news headlines\n",
    "* Writes a financial report about these assets based on all this information\n",
    "    * **Legal reviewer**: Check that the content is legally compliant.\n",
